# Getting startet with react-native and expo
This project uses react-native and expo globally installed. If not already available you can do this via console:

Install react native:
```
npm install -g react-native-cli
```

Install expo:
```
npm install -g expo-cli
```

Furthermore, you need to install AndroidStudio and run a virtual device with the Android Virtual Device Manager (AVD). This device needs to run on Android 9 (Pie).
